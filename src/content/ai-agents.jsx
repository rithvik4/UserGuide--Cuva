        Agents are AI-powered autonomous entities designed to solve open-ended goals. Unlike a standard Workflow—which follows a fixed, predetermined path—an Agent makes intelligent, real-time decisions about which tools to use and how to navigate data to achieve a desired outcome.

        In the Cuva AI ecosystem, AI Agents are autonomous software entities that act as "digital employees" capable of reasoning, making decisions, and executing tasks within a financial enterprise. Unlike traditional automation that follows rigid, pre-defined scripts, these agents use Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand intent and navigate complex workflows.
